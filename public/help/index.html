                            This project shows you how to remotely control a cat via the power of an Ardunio, 2 servos and a LASER BEAM!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We'll use the servos to control pan and tilt of a laser beam, which in turn seems to control the cat.
                            We'll set up a simple web server that will allow us to control the servos, laser, and hence the cat, over the Internet, all via JavaScript thanks to firmata and johnny five.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is inteded to be a guide, and I encourage you to tweak as you like rather than follow it. It's just plain old JavaScript and some plugging in of cables, so do fork it, break it, extend it, have fun, and makes some cats happy!

                        <span class="label label-warning">beginners note</span> always unplug the arduino before mounting components, I'm sure you knew about it, but, just in case :)
                    </p>

                            <span class="label label-info">Note</span> we are using two kind of electronic components here.
                        <p>
                        <p>
                            the led, is an polarized component, so it has 2 different pins, the anode (+) is the longer one, and the cathode (-) is the smaller one, you need to connect your led's cathode to the ground, and the anode to your' arduino digital pin 13, allowing you to control via javascript.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            the resistor is not polarized, so we don't have to worry about the side we link power to it, we use it to lower the current that the arduino is delivering to the led thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law">ohm's law</a>
                        </p>

                <p>
                    the plan is to create a closed circuit linking the ground of the arduino's power line to the 13th digital pin. <br>
                    there is no particular order to link things, but i usually start with the onboard components, so put the led on the board parallel to the power line, if you have one, then connect the anode (+, longest leg) to the resistor that you will also place in parallel to the power line,this resistor is used to reduce the amount of current in the led, that would not stand the 5v provided by the arduino. <br>
                    We will then connect the led cathode (-) to breadboard ground power line (if you have one), then from the breadboard's ground to the arduino's ground <br>
                    now we need to link the leg of the resistor that do not connect the led to the 13th digital pin of the arduino
                    <p>
                        our circuit is now closed, so it is time to jump on the computer

                <p>
                    open a terminal in the cloned repo and create a file, say myCat.js, open it in your editor
                </p>
                <p>let's take control of this led with command line !</p>
<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
    var five = require("johnny-five"),  // johnny-five, enable us to talk to sir arduino
        board = new five.Board(),       // it will contain objects that will allow us to manipulate hardware

    // borad initialisation

        // in this section we will create an instance of the led object for our led
        onlineLed = new five.Led(13);   // our led linked to the digital pin13

        // inject our hardware in the Repl, so we can talk with it in the command line
        board.repl.inject({

    });
    </code>
</pre>
                <p>
                    now <code>node myCat.js</code> and let's see what we can do!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="label label-info">Note</span> if you look at the led while the board boots, you can see that it is blinking, and that it blinks at the same time that the arduino onboard led is blinking, this is because the 13 th pin is link to this onboard led, that tells us the status of the board (remember your pc's beeps ?)
                </p>
                <p>
                    so now we have a REPL prompt, then ... <br>
                    then, we can call our led instance, to see what this is all about, <code>onlineLed.on()</code> and, tada a new led is lit !

                </p>
                    if you want to see more, you could dig in the /node_modules/johnny-five/eg/led-*.js files, but for now you should know about <code>onlineLed.on()</code>, <code>onlineLed.off()</code>, and <code>onlineLed.on()</code> <code>onlineLed.pulse()</code> (to remember the good old blink times)

                <p>
                    i will use our need of a laser to cover a few point worthwhile of attention when playing with electronics, first a bit of safety.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <span class="label label-important">CAUTION</span> laser ARE dangerous things, in Europe law prohibits too powerful lasers, but, still you can easily burn your retina, so, while the idea of making cat's crazy lead me into this, be careful with it, while working withe the device, point it to the opposite wall, if you play with your cat, don't play on reflective soils, and dim it with tracing paper for playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    then, laser also will draw lots of current, and your usb cable is not that good for that, it is supposed to deliver 5v at +/-500 mA per port, depending on the chip, and if it is a laptop, you could expect less ... So, if you play with a few leds, of a lcd display, supplying that with current is not a problem, but to power lasers or actuators, you will need more power than that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    if your setup is not too big, you can supply dc power to your arduino's board directly, and that would do the trick, otherwise, if you need for example more current that what the arduino can provide, you can use external power supply, but then this power source and the attached hardware would be outside our circuit, so we would need to control it somehow.
                <p>
                <h3>lady's and gentlemen, let me introduce our guest, the transistor</h3>
                <p>
                    this is what will help us doing that, transistors are marvelous pieces of engineering, a little swiss knife in the electronic army, you can amplify, or modulate a signal with it, switching things on and even more ... this is that make all the zero and ones we play with all day, i love them so much for that !
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are loads of transistor out there, and today we will play with bipolar transistor, mainly because there are some provided in all the starter kits out there, a little fellow named <a href="http://arduino.cc/documents/datasheets/BC547.pdf" target="_blank">BC547</a>, (or maybe a mosfet?).
                </p>
                <p>
                    basically divided in two main type, NPN and PNP, we will use NPN transistor for this project.<br>
                    both type have 3 pins one collector, one base, and one emitter, in the NPN ones it allow the current to flow from the collector to the emitter IF the current in the base is higher that the emitter's one allowing the current to flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                   by applying current to the base with our arduino, we will allow the current of the external source to flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="label label-info">Note</span> transistor's BC547 base is not meant to receive huge amount of current, so we will put a resistor between the base and the arduino's pin, i choose a common 560 ohm one, cause i had it laying around !
                </p>
                <p>
                    let's create a second circuit to our breadboard, from the external power source to the laser to close it in the ground.

                        <li>link the minus of the led to the emmiter</li>
                        <li>
                            link the base to the 560 ohms resistor
                        </li>
                        <li>link the other side of the 560 ohms resistor to pin 12 </li>
                        <li>link the collector of the transistor to the powerline's ground</li>

                    Since i know you all are code oriented geeks, rather than write a lot about simple Js patterns that you may already know about, 
                    I decided that i will provide some heavily commented code examples, and leave you tweak it at your will. <br>
                    but i won't leave you in the wild with no explanation either so here is a basic breakdown of the code furnished.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            config.js : configuration file, alloy you to setup host adress and port, log generation and launch the tcp server </li>
                        <li>
                            server.js : code for the server, i separated the turret and the server code, to allow for a remote deployement of the service.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            cat.js : code for the turret
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            lib/tcpPortServer : you can enable it in the config file, it is use for devices that are not compatible with websockets (i used it for a processing thing)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            lib/briquet.js : briquet (lighter in french) is a small literal object i use to configure led actions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            public/scripts/control.js : simple X/Y controller that send that to the io server. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    this code is simple, but yet more complex that it could have been, you could for example ditch the whole server and tcp socket stuff if you code the server and the tower in the same file no need for socket things. briquet.js is overkill, and i'm sure you can see thing that could be trimmed down.<br>
                    I just felt that with these tools in hand, you could do way more than this simple example. no go, play, inspire me by showing me great stuff

                <p>
                    PWM stand for Pulse Width Modulation, it is a trick to get analog like result with your digital pins, do do so it emit a square wave by altering low and high current each cycle is divided in 256 parts, here you are my precious 8bits !!! <br>
